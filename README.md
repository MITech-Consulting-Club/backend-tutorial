# MITech Backend Tutorial

## Setting Up
1. [Clone this git repository](https://github.com/MITech-Consulting-Club/backend-tutorial)
2. Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) and [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/download) if you haven't already done so 
3. Open two terminals

### Backend
This has two files of interest, `final.js` which is the completed backend, and `index.js` which is what you should develop yourself
1. Navigate into the api folder
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `node index.js` for the in-progress version, and `node final.js` to use the example
    - Don't forget to save your file, quit the current running version (Ctrl+C), and re-running `node index.js` every time you make a change
    - Don't forget to save your file
    - I beg you not to forget to save your file

### Frontend
This is purely to see the results of your backend in a more polished fashion, so no need to change anything here past running these directions (unless you want to, please do)
1. Navigate into the web folder
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run dev`

## Following the Tutorial
Read over the extensive comments in `final.js` to get an understanding of what's happening, then go to `index.js` and attempt to fill it out based on the prompts, checking back to `final.js` when you need to, or better yet, looking out for online resources.
